# dotfiles

My config files that I've built upon from various repos.

Starting point: https://github.com/sdushantha/dots

* i3-gaps 
* Polybar
* Rofi to replace dmenu (it styles a little easier)
* Ranger for directory spelunking
* Dunst for notification management
* Compton for compositing (shadows, transparency, etc)
